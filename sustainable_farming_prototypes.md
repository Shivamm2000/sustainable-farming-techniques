## Vertical Farming:
 - Description: Vertical farming involves growing crops in vertically stacked layers or vertically inclined surfaces, often in controlled indoor environments.
 - Sustainability Benefits: It maximizes land use efficiency, reduces the need for large amounts of water, and allows for year-round crop production.

## Aquaponics:
 - Description: Aquaponics is a system that combines aquaculture (raising fish) with hydroponics (cultivation plants in water).
 - Sustainability Benefits: It creates a closed-loop system where fish waste provides nutrients for plants, and plants help purify the water for the fish.

## Agroforestry:
 - Description: Agroforestry integrates trees and shrubs into agricultural systems, promoting biodiversity and providing multiple products.
 - Sustainability Benefits: It enhances soil fertility, conserves water, reduces erosion, and provides habitats for beneficial organisms.
